        <h1>hi there</h1>
        <p>
            As you know my name is Yanik, I live on the austrian countryside next to fields and forests. I currently attend a higher technical collage, 1.5 hours away from home so a lot of my time gets wasted on travel. nonetheless, I manage to do lots of cool stuff in my Freetime, my favourite projects are outlined on the <a href="../index.html">main portfolio page</a>. On this here page I talk a bit more about my life experiences and hobbies.

        <h2>Filmmaking</h2>
        <p>
            In 2020 I started my education at HTL Leonding for IT and Media technology, at that point I was already interested in image editing, design and various creative work. In my second year at HTL I was introduced to video work and admittedly not very interested, the teaching was very theoretical and the cameras we were provided were old camcorders, worse then our phones. What got me hooked was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0YVtJUaNP4">lego stop motion</a> I did with a classmate. We went much further then was required by the task, created backdrops, a lighting setup, simple digital animations and the highlight: custom music created by <a href="http://www.coolcitymusic.com/styled-6/index.html">rik pfenniger</a>. Aditionally that year we created a dubbing for the trailer for the first harry potter. These two created a fascination for story telling in me, the following year I started planning my first short film with two friends. We convinced the teacher to give us a better camera and a gimbal and created the 8 minute action short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6PDqlk2Nf8">Revenge</a>. In the fourth grade we were again trying to one up ourselves and wrote a proper script with extensive dialoges, many different locations and a overall way more complex storyline. After countless hours of work in pre production, production and post production we created the 20 minute short film <a href="https://youtu.be/qDVY-5UF4PY?si=AjPJY8Xzmsz3th1Q">No Tomorrow</a>. Now I am in love with Filmmaking, dreaming of one day directing a big production feature film, obviously I have a long way to go but I started at a very young age and I will keep working on this dream until one day you see "written and directed by Yanik Kendler" on the big screen.

        <h2>Web development</h2>
        <p>At HTL the main focus of my branch was web development, in the second grade I started my first side project that allowed me to create and play custom <a href="https://github.com/elYanuki/Gameshow">Gameshows</a>. I worked on that project for about a year, constantly updating the technologies and adding features. For school I created various projects like a open canvas note-taking app, a interactive, animated advent calendar or the animal shelter app <a href="https://github.com/elYanuki/PetPal">Pet Pal</a>. I went on to work on more side-projects like a small library <a href="https://github.com/elYanuki/PopupEngine">Popup Engine</a> a app for <a href="https://github.com/elYanuki/dart-counter">counting dart scores</a>, started a web based puzzle game with a friend, or a electron app for creating fantasy world wikis: <a href="https://github.com/elYanuki/WorldManager">World Manager</a>. In the fourth grade we started a 1.5 year long Project for the school itself: a app for digitalizing the renting of video equipment to students. Sadly we were not allowed to use a proper framework for this, so lots of time was wasted on rewriting systems that would already be present in most web-frameworks. Nonetheless it is my biggest and most complex project to date, having a multitude of features and a complex backend.
        <br>
        For completing the school and getting my Matura we need to create a project for a company, usually as part of an internship. We made a learning platform that allows the companies customers to learn and understand the features of a complex ERP tool by watching videos and answering quizzes. Now all thats left is to write my Diploma thesis, successfully master the school year and pass the matura... aand then I can start working a real job. I will probably do web-dev and/or UI-design for a while and fund a few short films as a hobby, enter a few into film festivals and hope for the best.
